This project distributes the problem of matching two ontologies on query level. To this end, the following workflow is implemented:

* Creation of Graphical Representations of SPARQL, Cypher, SQL, etc. queries
* Automated ontology matching between the source and the target ontology using AML https://github.com/AgreementMakerLight
* Manual translation of remaining query elements with simultaneous extraction of ontology correspondences
