 *
 * This class is a generalisation of a consensus aggregation.
 * It is fed by "ingesting" various alignments, i.e., collecting and counting their correspondences
 * Then the extraction of an alignement is made by extracting an alignment
 * So the aggregator works with the following interface:
 * aggr = new ConsensusAggregator();
 * aggr.ingest( Alignment );
 * aggr.ingest( Alignment );
 * ...
 * aggr.extract( double, boolean )
 * or
 * aggr.extract( int, boolean )
 * for the interpretation of these two primitives, see the definition of extract.
 *
 * There could be also a possibility to introduce a hook depending on the entities to be compared. 
 * For instance, in multilingual matching, if the labels are one word, then n=5, if they are more than one word, n=2
